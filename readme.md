# Programming in C
## Chapter 8
### Question 8

This problem is from chapter 8 of the textbook[^1]. It is to create a program to calculate the roots of a quadratic function.


To test the program try:
* a = 1; b = 3; c = 0;  (discriminant > 0)
* a = 1; b = 2; c = 1;  (discriminant = 0)
* a = 1; b = 0; c = 2;  (discriminant < 0)

You may wish to run the program and compare its output.
